#Magic Pro
A web-based life counter, game manager and toolbox for your Magic: The Gathering games. This repo is used to publish sourcecode, track bugs and discuss improvements.

##Reporting Bugs
I can't test on all devices and there are numerous bugs that could appear, so I need you to report bugs as soon as you encounter them by providing the following information:
- device name
- OS name and version
- what you expected to see
- what you actually saw
- anything you can provide to try and fix it (if you can)

##Suggesting Features
This app is no-where near complete. I rely on you to use it and think of ways to improve it. You can suggest features and changes in this repo and even better: perform the changes yourself and push them into this repo. I'm only one developer with other commitments, so I need help making this app the best it can be.

##Legal
All sourcecode is copyrighted to myself and belongs to me. That so, I encourage you to submit your own code for inclusion in the app, and I will make a personal mention of you wherever I can (either in the repo, on the official website or in the app itself).

"Magic: The Gathering", the logo and any mention of the card game belongs to Wizards Of The Coast. This app was made to aid gamers, not steal work. Please buy their game and support Magic.
